# useClickOutside

The `useClickOutside` hook is designed to detect and respond to clicks outside a specified DOM element. This can be particularly useful for closing modal dialogs, dropdown menus, or resetting state when the user interacts with the rest of your application.

## Interface

```typescript
interface UseClickOutsideProps {
  ref: RefObject<HTMLElement>;
  callback: (event: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => void;
}
```

The `UseClickOutsideProps` interface requires:

- ref: A `RefObject` pointing to the element you want to monitor.
- callback: A function that will be called whenever a click occurs outside of the referenced element.

## Usage

To use `useClickOutside`, pass it a reference to the element you want to monitor and a callback function. The callback will be invoked whenever a user clicks outside of the referenced element.

Here's an example of how to use `useClickOutside` within a component:


```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { useClickOutside } from 'hooked-on-react';

const Dropdown = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  const dropdownRef = useRef(null);

  useClickOutside(dropdownRef, (event) => {
    // If the dropdown is open and the click is outside, close it
    if (isOpen) {
      onClose();
    }
  });

  return (
    <div ref={dropdownRef} className={`dropdown ${isOpen ? 'open' : ''}`}>
      {/* Dropdown content here */}
    </div>
  );
};

```

In this Dropdown component example, `useClickOutside` is used to detect if a click occurs outside of the dropdown. If the click is outside and the dropdown is open, the onClose function is called, which should close the dropdown.
