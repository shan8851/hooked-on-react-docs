# useCopyText

The `useCopyText` hook provides a straightforward interface for copying text to the clipboard. It offers a simple way to trigger copy operations with feedback on the operation's success or failure.

## Interface

```typescript
interface UseCopyTextReturn {
  copiedText: string;
  isCopySuccess: boolean | null;
  copy: (text: string) => void;
  error: Error | null;
}
```
The `UseCopyTextReturn` interface details the structure of the object returned by useCopyText. It includes:

- copiedText: The last text that was attempted to be copied.
- isCopySuccess: A boolean that indicates whether the last copy attempt was successful.
- copy: A function that takes a string and attempts to copy it to the clipboard.
- error: An error object that captures any issues encountered during the copy operation.


## Usage

Below is an example demonstrating how to use useCopyText to copy text from an input field to the clipboard and provide user feedback.

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCopyText } from 'hooked-on-react';

const CopyExample = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('Hello, world!');
  const { copy, isCopySuccess, error } = useCopyText();

  const handleCopy = () => {
    copy(text);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="Text to copy"
      />
      <button onClick={handleCopy}>Copy to Clipboard</button>
      {isCopySuccess && <p>Copied!</p>}
      {error && <p>Failed to copy: {error.message}</p>}
    </div>
  );
};
```
In this example, `copy` is used to initiate the copy to clipboard operation, and `isCopySuccess` provides immediate feedback to the user. The error state is used to display any errors that may occur during the copy process, allowing for graceful error handling within the UI.
